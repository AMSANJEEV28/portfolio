        Howdy there, fellow techies! My name is <span class="name">A M Sanjeev</span>, but you can call me
        Sanjeev, or even just "hey you!" if you're feeling casual. I'm a
        third-year computer science and engineering student at FET, Gurukula
        Kangri (Deemed to be University) Haridwar, Uttarakhand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I know what you're thinking: "Oh great, another coder who takes
        themselves way too seriously." But fear not, my friends, for I am here
        to prove that techies can have a sense of humor too!
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what am I all about? Well, for starters, I'm a web development
        enthusiast. I love nothing more than sitting down with my computer and
        crafting beautiful, functional websites that would make even the most
        seasoned programmer swoon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I know what you're thinking: "This guy sounds like a jack of all
        trades, master of none." But don't let my diverse skill set fool you -
        I'm constantly on the lookout for opportunities to learn and grow. In
        fact, I'm currently working as a teaching assistant at Pupilfirst and a
        Technical content contributor at Dev Academy.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, there you have it folks. That's me in a nutshell. If you want to get
        in touch, you can call me at 9608685873, shoot me an email at
        amsanjeev28@gmail.com, or drop me a line at 206320028@gkv.ac.in. Until
        next time, happy coding!
